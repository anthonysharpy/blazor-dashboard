## Features

- History bar allows users to easily jump forwards and backwards in time - useful for cross-referencing multiple pages.
- Page preview feature on hover.
- Data is refetched on component load; no confusingly stale data.
- Event logs track actions taken within in the dashboard.

## How To Run

Run `dotnet watch` from a terminal in the blazor-dashboard directory. Probably requires .NET 7.

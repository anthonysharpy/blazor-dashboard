# blazor-dashboard
An example Blazor Server dashboard I wrote.

Note that this doesn't currently have mobile support. I could add it but... I'm probably not going to ;-) As an internal system dashboard it's mainly geared towards PCs anyway. If you want to see an example of a mobile-supported site, check out my portfolio! https://anthonysharpy.dev/

## How To Run

Run `dotnet watch` from a terminal in the blazor-dashboard directory. Probably requires .NET 7.
